## 🔎 Intro:

Welcome to my project showcasing a modern and organized approach to building a profile card with dynamic tabs using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project aims to provide a streamlined and modular structure for displaying profile information through a responsive and visually appealing UI.

**`Key features include`**:

- **Profile Card**: A visually appealing card displaying user information and a profile picture.
- **Dynamic Tabs**: Tabs for displaying different sections such as About Me, Experience, Tech Stack, and Contact information.
- **Reusable Components**: Utilizes reusable components like TabButtons for seamless navigation between tabs.
- **Organized Structure**: Follows a structured approach with components organized into **components**, **common**, and **styles** directories for clarity and maintainability.

This project not only demonstrates proficiency in modern web development technologies but also emphasizes best practices in component-based architecture and user interface design. Whether you're exploring frontend development or looking for inspiration in organizing complex UI components, this project serves as a practical example of effective implementation.
